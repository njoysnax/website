# Centum Nutrifoods — Website

This is the improved, responsive company portfolio site.

## How to run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step or server is required.

### Notes
- No external frameworks or CDNs are used — pure HTML/CSS + minimal vanilla JS.
- The home page hero uses a lightweight carousel that auto-rotates, pauses on hover, and supports swipe on mobile.
- On-scroll, text cards reveal with subtle animations (disabled if **prefers-reduced-motion** is on).

## Quick test checklist
- Hero image area is centered vertically & horizontally and is noticeably larger.
- Carousel: auto-rotates, pauses on hover (desktop), supports swipe (mobile).
- Text sections appear in elegant “cards” and reveal on scroll.
- All pages are responsive without overflow or cut-off text.
- Images keep aspect ratio (no stretching) and use `object-fit: cover` where needed.
